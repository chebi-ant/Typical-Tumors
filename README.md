Typical Tumors: Cancer Curiosity is a retro gaming–styled educational platform designed to make cancer science accessible, engaging, and understandable. The project transforms complex concepts from oncology, cancer biology, treatment, and research into digestible explanations presented through an 8-bit, terminal-inspired aesthetic. By combining clear scientific communication with interactive design, Typical Tumors lowers the barrier to understanding cancer without compromising medical accuracy or sensitivity toward patients and families.

The platform features an extensive Cancer Curiosity Blog with over fifty posts exploring cancer biology, modern treatments, prevention strategies, and emerging research. The site is built around a classic green-on-black visual style inspired by early computer terminals and arcade systems. Disease Dungeon, an educational turn-based game currently in beta, allows users to battle cancer cells while learning real oncology concepts through gameplay. Additional interactive learning tools and cancer knowledge quizzes are in development to further reinforce understanding through engagement.

Typical Tumors is built using HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript, with no external frameworks or dependencies, and is fully responsive across devices. The site is hosted on GitHub Pages and requires no installation to use. Users can explore the content by navigating the interface, executing blog posts to read detailed explanations, or entering Disease Dungeon to learn through interactive mechanics.

The design philosophy of Typical Tumors emphasizes accessibility by presenting complex science without unnecessary jargon, engagement through gaming language and visuals, accuracy through evidence-based information, and compassion through thoughtful presentation of sensitive topics. The project was created to educate and empower through knowledge, recognizing that cancer affects millions worldwide and that understanding it should not require a medical degree.
